## 🧠 How It Works

### Backend (Rule-Based AI)

**Method:** Pattern Matching using Regular Expressions

1. **User sends a message** → API receives it
2. **Intent Detection** → Regex patterns match the query
3. **Response Generation** → Returns predefined response for that intent
4. **Fallback** → If no intent matches, returns helpful fallback

**Example:**
```javascript
User: "How to login?"
→ Matches pattern: /how.*(login|sign in)/i
→ Intent: "login_help"
→ Returns: Step-by-step login instructions
```

### Why Rule-Based?

✅ **Fast** - Instant responses (< 50ms)
✅ **Accurate** - 100% control over responses
✅ **No Training Needed** - Works immediately
✅ **Lightweight** - No ML models required
✅ **Predictable** - Same query = Same response
✅ **Easy to Update** - Just add new patterns/responses

### Frontend (React)

- Beautiful chat UI with animations
- Real-time message updates
- Quick reply buttons
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Typing indicators
- Error handling

    /another.*pattern/i
  ],
  responses: [
